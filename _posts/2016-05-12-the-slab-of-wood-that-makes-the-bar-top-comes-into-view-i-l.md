The slab of wood that makes the bar top comes into view. I lift my body from a hunched over positon, carefully moving my head because the rush of blood can sometimes cause dizziness. The same napkin that keeps falling everytime I turned around to look at the ananlog clock face hanging on the wall.

It is still 1:00pm but I could have sworn that at least five minutes have gone by. I'm not even sure why I'm in a hurry. I'm technically one of the boss' and I don't have anything pressing until the evening, but I made an internal promise that I would arrive at 1:30pm for roll call to all the people I work with who don't care one way or the other if I come into the office on time. Self-imposed importance is a curse.

I lay the npakin back on my lap and take another bite of my salad and notice that the taste of greens with cut-up apples, crushed walnuts, diced chicken and balsamic vingear is pleasantly salty. I'm hunched over my food because there is a strange banister attached to this bar table, probably to stop drinks from spilling over the table, but when you're short it feels like a fence with jagged points that you avoid.

Slouched over, I take another bite and think about the meeting this evening but I stop at just the thought of the word meeting. Instead a feeling that I've been wrestling to uncover and define keeps surfacing into the mundance tasks of my day like eating a salad.
